# How will DeployLite grow?

DeployLite is an open-source, community-oriented, self-hosted deployment control plane. This roadmap separates the verified `main` baseline from incomplete planned P0–P8 work, so contributors can evaluate scope without treating a future phase as shipped behavior.

## Page plan

| Topic | Plan |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Explain the public roadmap and each phase boundary |
| Audience | Contributors, operators, and prospective users |
| Content | Verified baseline, planned phases, and community expectations |
| Open questions | Priorities, maintainers, and phase proposals are decided in public project discussion |

## Start from the verified baseline

The `main` branch provides an HTTP-first VPS installer, first-owner setup, cookie sessions and RBAC, project metadata management, encrypted environment-value foundations with masked handling, control-plane deployment and log metadata, a read-only MCP surface, bounded runtime-port handling with tests, and a protected hosted baseline CI pipeline.

The existing deployment-control and agent surfaces are not a real production executor. Real production execution, privileged host mutation, provenance/signing, VPS smoke, routing, certificates, and release approval are planned rather than implemented.

## Follow the planned phases

Each phase has an outcome and an acceptance boundary. A phase is not complete until its acceptance boundary is met.

| Phase | Planned outcome | Acceptance boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Harden the shared command, capability, secret, and audit model | Every new mutation has actor, project scope, idempotency, audit evidence, and a terminal result; unsupported actions are rejected |
| P1 | Add a real, secure Git and Dockerfile deployment path plus a curated, versioned catalog | Repository and build inputs validate deterministically; templates reference secrets instead of embedding values; real execution has regression and safety coverage |
| P2 | Add multi-service projects through validated Docker Compose before Swarm | Compose inputs are parsed, canonicalized, policy-validated, dry-runable, and secret-safe; stack logs and replacement behavior have integration coverage |
| P3 | Add servers, registries, networks, volumes, domains, routing, certificates, TCP, and UDP | Server enrollment is scoped and expiring; registry credentials remain encrypted and redacted; routing is idempotent; ownership, renewal, and routing rollback have observable tests |
| P4 | Add stateful workloads and operations | Managed databases have isolated storage, generated credentials, backups, retention, restore confirmation, and restore evidence; telemetry never exposes secrets |
| P5 | Add CI/CD, webhooks, notifications, scheduling, observability, healthchecks, and tenant governance | Automation is idempotent and cancellable; integrations have delivery status; authorization tests deny cross-tenant access; events trace to a source command |
| P6 | Publish a versioned API and controlled MCP writes | API tokens are scoped and rotatable; MCP writes use the same command, audit, idempotency, authorization, and confirmation path as the web interface |
| P7 | Add audited AI assistance | AI receives allowlisted redacted context, links recommendations to evidence, and can only request a normal command preview; it cannot autonomously control infrastructure |
| P8 | Complete production operations and release readiness | Production execution, VPS smoke, provenance/signing, Traefik/ACME routing, infrastructure mutation, rollback, and release approval pass their independent evidence gates |

## Keep planned work honest

The roadmap includes real Git and Dockerfile execution, Docker Compose, Swarm, networks, volumes, backups, managed databases, service-level secrets, routing, certificates, TCP, UDP, catalog applications, registries, deployment CI/CD, webhooks, observability, healthchecks, functional rollback, and remote build servers. None of these items is implemented unless the verified baseline says so. The hosted baseline pipeline and advisory local evidence bridge do not make DeployLite production-ready.

DeployLite will not copy third-party code, templates, credentials, private endpoints, or deployment configuration into this project. References may inform a problem statement, but DeployLite defines and tests its own public behavior.

## Contribute within the safety boundary

Read [how to contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening work. Read [the security policy](../SECURITY.md) before reporting a vulnerability.

Contributions must keep secrets encrypted at rest, redacted in every read path, and outside AI and MCP context. Infrastructure mutations must use a shared command boundary with authorization, audit evidence, idempotency, capability negotiation, and a visible terminal result.
